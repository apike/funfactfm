Serenity Caldwell joins us to discuss the Apple TV as a gaming platform. We talk about what games we've tried so far, the weaknesses of the Siri Remote, and what kind of games could be great on Apple TV. We discuss runner games, party games, and gams that are purposely bad. Afterwards we talk about Star Wars, since this episode was recorded in December when that was the cool thing to do.
