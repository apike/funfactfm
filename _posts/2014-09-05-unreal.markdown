Martiancraft's [Jeff LaMarche](http://www.twitter.com/jeff_lamarche) joins us to discuss 3D game engines. We discuss the core features of a game engine, what Unity brings to the table, and why it has become so popular for indie games like Martiancraft's [Republic Sniper](http://martiancraft.com/republicsniper.html). Then we dig in to Unreal, Jeff's team's switch to it from Unity, and what makes it so wonderfully fantastic.
